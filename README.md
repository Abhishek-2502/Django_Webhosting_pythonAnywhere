```python
# +++++++++++ DJANGO +++++++++++

import os
import sys

path = '/home/AbhishekRajput/django_webhosting/django_webhosting' #Change this path where your manage.py is present
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)

os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'django_webhosting.settings' #Change this path where your settings.py is present

from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()

```
